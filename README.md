TFRRS-Athlete-Filter
====================

[TFFRS](http://tfrrs.org/) is a website dedicated to providing collegiate track & field results.  I mainly use the site for keeping up to date on the nationals performance lists.  TFRRS lists the current top 50 performances in each event, so it's an easy way to see who will be going to nationals and what it takes to actually qualify for nationals.

This Chrome browser extensions makes it easy to see athletes' performances from a specified list of schools.  The extension will highlight the rows in the giant table of results for those athletes.  In the image below, I've edited `config.js` to contain a list of school names from the MIAC conference.  As you can see, the athletes form the MIAC are easy to pick out from the table!
